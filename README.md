# Welcome to the Simple Todo List in Angular 1

## What is this?

This site is an example of how to create a simple todo list using [Angular 1](http://www.angularjs.org) and [ASP.NET Core](http://dotnet.github.io)
I wanted to show basic CRUD functionality as well a simple routing and then compare and contrast this implementation to an [Angular2](http://www.angular.io) solution.
This site makes use of the [ui-router library](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router), [toastr](https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr) and [bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) but you can see that on the index.html page.
    
I used Sqlite for the DB and Entity Framework for DB Connectivity.
I also employed the repository pattern for the DB connection code and registered the Interface for the repository in Startup.cs.

Please note that this is just a simple implementation and there are many ways to do this (as is the case with all software).
This is not meant to be a reference implementation.

##why was it created?

The site was created in order to show the differences between building a simple todo list using Angular 1 and Angular 2.
[You can see the Angular 2 version of the site here] and [get the code for both sites on Github.com](http://github.com/aritzcovan/simpleTodoAng1)

##Special thanks
I would like to thank [John Papa](http://www.johnpapa.me). I incorporated the logging block that he outlines in his ng-demos/modular project.
[You can check out all of that very useful code here](https://github.com/johnpapa/ng-demos/tree/master/modular) Thanks John!!
