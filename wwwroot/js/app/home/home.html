<h3>what is this?</h3>
<p>
    This site is an example of how to create a simple todo list using Angular 1. 
    I wanted to show basic CRUD functionality as well a simple routing and then compare and contrast this implementation to an Angular2 solution.
    This site makes use of the ui-router library, toastr and bootstrap but you can see that on the index.html page.
    
    Please note that this is just a simple implementation and there are many ways to do this (as is the case with all software).
    This is not meant to be a reference implementation.

<h3>why did you create it?</h3>
<p>the site was created in order to show the differences between building a simple todo list using Angular 1 and Angular 2.<br/>
    You can see the Angular 2 version of the site here and get the code for both sites on Github.com</p>
    
<h3>special thanks</h3>
<p>
    I would like to thank john papa as I incorporated one of the blocks that he uses in his Angular modular project in this project. Specifically, I used the logging block
    that makes use of the toastr library that he was involved in creating. Thanks John!
